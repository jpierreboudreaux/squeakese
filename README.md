Procedurally Generated Language
Squeakese is a project intended to mimic a "conlang" or constructed language.
However, unlike most conlangs I implemented some (severe) limitations, and
is mostly constructed not by human specification but a machine algorithm. The
language itself is based on that spoken by Kronk in the 2000 film The Emperor's
New Groove. It can be seen in these soundbytes:

I limited the language to use five words: squeak, squeaky, squeaker, squeakin,
and squeakity. To translate I used the Oxford 3000 which contains 3000 of
the most common/ useful words in english. Under these limitations I was still
able to come up with a system where each English word is represented by around ~4
squeakese words. I also did have a "predefined" section to brute force add the
words which are "canon" to the movie as best I could. Apart from being a fun
project it does also make me wonder if I could alter it so that it has more value
in encrypting messages between peers.
Currently there are still a few bugs but I hope to improve it in the meantime.
